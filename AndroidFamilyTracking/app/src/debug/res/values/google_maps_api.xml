    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    BD:48:40:AD:3C:DE:C6:09:CF:F2:65:C3:1F:98:5D:21:1F:BC:12:7F

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    BD:48:40:AD:3C:DE:C6:09:CF:F2:65:C3:1F:98:5D:21:1F:BC:12:7F

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.

    <string name="google_maps_key" templateMergeStrategy="preserve" translatable="false">
